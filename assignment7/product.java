//The product data should include a product code, description, price and product count. 
//In addition to the getter and setter method, the class should implement toString and also a formatted output of the price (Hint: use the NumberFormat class. Here is the implementation of your formattedPrice method: 
 //public String getPriceFormatted() 
   // {
     //   String formattedPrice = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance().format(this.price);
       // return formattedPrice;
    //}
//From the client app create instance of 2-3 different products and use the toString method to display their data.
//Optional: Keep track of the count of the products created and call the getCount method to verify that it is correct. (Where could you keep track of the count of products?)
