//Write a method called isSorted that accepts an array of real numbers as a parameter and returns true if the list is sorted (nondecreasing) 
//order and false otherwise. For example, if arrays list1 and list2 store [16.1, 12.3, 22.2, 14.4] and [1.5, 4.3, 7.0, 19.5, 25.1, 46.2]
//respectively the calls isSorted(list1) and isSorted(list2) and should return false and true respectively. Assume the array has at least
//one element. A one-element array is considered sorted.
